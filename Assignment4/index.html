                <p> The visualization is separated into two parts.
                    First, on the left, all 40 hand outlines a shown on top of each other.
                    The right part, shows the first two dimensions of the PCA, one for each hand outline.
                    By clicking the points in the scatter plot, the corresponding hand is outlined with red.
                    Furthermore, the index of the point, along with the x and y value shows as an tooltip when mouse over.

                    A PCA simply selects the k most significant dimensions based on variance. In this case,
                    since we want to visualize the PCA, the two first dimensions are selected.
                    This makes for a good 2D visualization scatter plot.
                    In this specific dataset we therefore see pattern that spread-out fingers are on the left points in the PCA.
                    The fingers close together, are to the right, in the PCA representation.
                    Furthermore, the higher the points are placed, the more spread out the thumb and index finger finger.
                    The little and ring finger are more separated as lower the PCA point is placed in the scatter plot.
