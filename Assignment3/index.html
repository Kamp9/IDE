        The layout of the tree based visualization are build in dTree, a D3 library <a href="https://github.com/ErikGartner/dTree">found here</a>. We changed the trump family json file to fit the new format for dTree. Furthermore we made some alterations to the source code, in order to make the tree more spacious, and hereby readable. Furthermore we changed the colors in a way, that we get a blue for the males and pink for the female nodes, in the tree. Each layer in the tree represent a parent relationship to the children nodes in the layer below. Multiple partners, and children with different partners, are in this case possible. We also added some interactiveness, by making links to a google search by clicking on names in the tree. The tree is also interactive in the sense that you can both zoom in and out, along with moving the tree around in the browser window.
        <br>
        We would further like to improve the visualization, by adding additional nodes to the existing tree. This would also allow the user to make a family tree from scratch, which would be very useful.
