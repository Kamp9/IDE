    <li><a href="http://server3.wikisky.org/?locale=EN/">WIKIsky interactive visualization</a></li>
The wikisky visualization gives a detailed presentation of the sky(space) with images taken from from different telescopes.
The visualization provides a nice list of the most interesting areas. However, navigating the map itself is quiete difficult as the zoom is only operateable by a slider, and not the mousewheel. The buttons for toggling various properties for the map could be more polished and have an indication whether they are on or off.
    <li><a href="http://www.tracemedia.co.uk/projects/luminous/flickr/#date_from=2014-01-01&date_to=2016-07-31&map=id&path_alpha=0.5&path_length=0&place=istanbul_01"> Luminous Cities interactive visualization</a></li>
    The scrollbars in the right side, makes alterations easy and transparent. However even with the largest point scale
    the illumination points, seems very small and hard to separate unless the zoom is very enhanced, which makes the
    overview less manageable. It would however, be useful to choose more than a single city, at the time, for better
    comparing cities.
